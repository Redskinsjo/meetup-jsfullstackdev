# Meetups

I am participating in meetups on fullstack development on meetup.com (/jsfullstackdev).
This code is representing time complexity and performances issues for main operations around the Array in coding.

On top of it, the binary search algorithm performances are illustrated here between an ordered and an unordered array.

It would be a pleasure to meet up with you, don't hesitate to join us on the events !

Thank you for participating.
